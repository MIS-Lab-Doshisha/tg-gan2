**Task-guided GAN II (TG GAN II)** is an advanced data augmentation method that utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance sample sizes in limited datasets for connectome-based prediction tasks.  

This code has been tested with **Python 3.9.13**.

## How to Train the Synthesis Model (TG GAN II / WGAN-GP)  

### 1. Install Dependencies  

Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare the Dataset for Augmentation  

#### 2.1 Structural Connectivity Matrices  

- Prepare the structural connectivity matrices that will be augmented and store them in the **`data/`** directory.  
- This project uses `.mat` files to store structural connectivity matrices. Example data can be found in the **`data/`** directory.  

#### 2.2 Objective Variables  

- Prepare the objective variables (targets) to be predicted and store them in the **`data/`** directory as well.  
- The objective variables should be formatted in a table as shown below:  

    | Index | Participant ID | NIH Toolbox Score |
    |---|---|---|
    | 1 | sub-ON41606 | 332 |
    | 2 | sub-ON89475 | 340 |
    | ... | ... | ... |

### 3. Train TG GAN II / WGAN-GP  

#### 3.1 Create a PyTorch-Compatible Dataset  

- The synthesis models in this project are implemented using **PyTorch**, so the dataset (structural connectivity matrices and their objective variables) must be converted into a **PyTorch-compatible format**.  
- The functions for creating a PyTorch-compatible dataset are defined in **`utils/load_dataset.py`**, based on the data structure in the **`data/`** directory.  

üìå Reference: [PyTorch Data Loading Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html)  

#### 3.2 Define Training Parameters  

- TG GAN II and WGAN-GP require several parameters for training. These should be set **before starting the training process**.  
- The main training scripts are:  
  - **TG GAN II**: `tg-gan-2/tg-gan-2_sc.py`  
  - **WGAN-GP**: `wgan-gp_sc.py`  

##### Common Parameters  

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `data_dir` | Path to the dataset directory containing structural connectivity matrices and objective variables. |
| `n_epochs` | Maximum number of training epochs. |
| `n_critics` | Number of critic training steps per generator update. |
| `dropout_rate` | List of dropout rates for critics, generator, and regressor (only in TG GAN II). |
| `n_features` | Number of latent space dimensions. |
| `n_regions` | Number of brain regions (i.e., rows/columns in structural connectivity matrices). |

Additionally, the following optional parameters can be tuned:  

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `alpha` | Learning rate for the critics, generator, and regressor. |
| `betas` | Beta parameters for the Adam optimizer. |
| `start` | Minimum number of epochs to be trained |
| `patience` | Number of epochs to wait before stopping training if the loss does not improve |

##### TG GAN II-Specific Parameters  

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `alphas` | List of alpha values used for the balancing the WGAN-GP loass and regressor loss. |

#### 3.3 Run the Training Script  

- Once the parameters are correctly defined, you can run the training script:  

```bash
python tg-gan-2/tg-gan-2_sc.py
python wgan/wgan-gp_sc.py
```

- The training process will generate the following output files:  

| Output File | Description |
|---|---|
| `loss_{n_epoch}.pkl` | Loss values recorded up to *n_epoch*. |
| `checkpoint_encoder_epoch_{n_epoch}.pth` | Encoder model checkpoint at *n_epoch*. |
| `checkpoint_decoder_epoch_{n_epoch}.pth` | Decoder model checkpoint at *n_epoch*. |
| `checkpoint_critics_epoch_{n_epoch}.pth` | Critics model checkpoint at *n_epoch*. |
| `checkpoint_regressor_epoch_{n_epoch}.pth` | Regressor model checkpoint at *n_epoch*. |
|  |  |
| `loss.pkl` | Loss values for all epochs. |
| `checkpoint_encoder.pth` | Final trained encoder model. |
| `checkpoint_decoder.pth` | Final trained decoder model. |
| `checkpoint_critics.pth` | Final trained critics model. |
| `checkpoint_regressor.pth` | Final trained regressor model. |

## How to Generate New Samples Using the Trained Model  

Once the synthesis models have been trained, they can be used to generate new samples.  

You can use the script **`utils/synthesizer.py`**.  
The function **`matrices_targets_synthesizer`** in `synthesizer.py` is the main function for synthesizing new structural connectivity matrices and objective variables.  

Example usage can be found in:  
- `regressor/synthesizer_tg-gan-2-sc.py`  
- `synthesizer_wgan-gp-sc.py`  

#### Usage: `matrices_targets_synthesizer` (in `synthesizer.py`)  

#### **Inputs:**  

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `encoder` | Trained encoder model. |
| `decoder` | Trained decoder model. |
| `matrices` | Structural connectivity matrices to augment (`n_samples, n_regions, n_regions`). |
| `targets` | Objective variables to augment (`n_samples,`). |
| `n_splits` | Number of interpolations. |

Ô∏è **Warning:** Ensure that the structural connectivity matrices and objective variables are **sorted in the same order** based on the objective variables.  

#### **Outputs:**  

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `synthesized_matrices` | Synthesized structural connectivity matrices. |
| `synthesized_targets` | Synthesized objective variables. |

## How to Evaluate Synthesis Models Performance

After the synthesis models have been trained, their synthesis performance shold be evaluated.
In order to  evaluate the model performance, you can use scripts in **`tg-gan-2`**, **`wgan`**, and **`graph`** directories. 

### 1. Evaluate the latent space
In this research, we evaluated the latent space generated by TG GAN II and WGAN-GP encoders. 

You can use the scripts **`tg-gan-2/tg-gan-2-sc_latent-space.py`** and **`wgan/wgan-gp-sc_latent-space.py`** and conduct the latent space analysis described below.

**1.1 Latent space visualization**
  - Latent space generated by TG GAN II and WGAN-GP encoders can be embedded and visualized using principal component analysis

**1.2 Correlation analysis between latent space and objective scores**
  - The correlation between principal component scores of latent space and objective scores can be visualized and measured by Pearson's metrics.

<!-- ### 2. Evaluate graph theory metrics
We also evaluated structural connectivity matrices synthesized by TG GAN II and WGAN-GP models.

You can use the scripts in **`graph`** directory.
The analysis overview of each script in this directory is described below.

**2.1 Simirality between acquired and synthesized matrices on the average matrix**

**2.2 Simirality between acquired and synthesized matrices on each matrix**

**2.3 Visualize acquired and synthesized matrices as the connectivity matrix**

**2.4 Visualize acquired and synthesized matrices on the brain skeleton** -->
